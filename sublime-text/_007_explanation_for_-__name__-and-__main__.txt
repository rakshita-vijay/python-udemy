if __name__ == "__main__":
    # code to execute if [1]
else:
    # code to execute if [2]

[1]: .py file is run directly and not through importing into another .py script 
[2]: .py file is not run directly and is imported into another .py script 

usually, programmers have the .py file body as a bunch of functions only, and then organize it in the (if __name__ == "__main__") block however they want - a few functions may be present in if(...) and not in else(...), and vice versa
